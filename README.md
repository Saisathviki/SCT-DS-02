Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Overview

This project focuses on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using a dataset of choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to preprocess the data, handle missing values, and explore relationships between variables to identify patterns and trends.

Features

Data cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies

Data visualization: Generating insightful plots to understand distributions and relationships

Feature engineering: Creating new variables to improve model performance

Correlation analysis: Identifying relationships between different features

Statistical insights: Summarizing key trends and patterns in the data
